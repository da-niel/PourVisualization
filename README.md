# Coffee Pourover Visualization

## Introduction
[Pourover coffee](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html) is a manual
way to make a cup or two of coffee at a time. From coffee particle size to water temperature, consistency is king when making coffee. An often overlooked point of variability is the actual pour itself. The pour is typically from a [narrow spouted kettle](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=gooseneck+kettle) and in circles over a bed of coffee.

My visualization tool uses basic tracking and edge detection techniques in openCV to determine pour-to-pour variability.
