# Coffee Pourover Visualization

## Introduction
[Pourover coffee](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html) is a great
way to make a cup or two of coffee at a time. The aspiration of every pourover coffee enthusiast is to be able to repeat their recipe
everytime. An often overlooked point of variability is the actual 'pour' itself. The pour is typically from a [narrow spouted kettle](https://www.google.com/search?q=gooseneck+kettle)
and in circles over a bed of coffee.
